Various systems have been designed to track the human\u0026rsquo;s position, actions, and vital signs by analyzing the radio signals reflected off the human body. However, most existing works can only predict rough human information. In this project, we build a multimodal system to enable the fine-grained human activity perception and imaging using radio signals, which consists of three major components: data collection, RF signal processing, and deep learning models. The data collection component collects human activity images from optical cameras and corresponding radio signals from RF devices. The RF signal processing component transforms the radio signals to the signal amplitude heatmaps. The deep learning models can generate human pose keypoints, pose segmentation, or human activity images based on the radio signal heatmaps. Furthermore, to train and test our proposed system, we create a cross-modal dataset, i.e., RFVisionData.\n","date":1628335835,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628335835,"objectID":"4cc190ee2706075a01b9ecafa0a18ada","permalink":"/projects/humanactivityperception/","publishdate":"2021-08-07T19:30:35+08:00","relpermalink":"/projects/humanactivityperception/","section":"projects","summary":"In recent years, building radio sensing systems to perceive and understand the activities of humans has drawn increasing attention, mainly due to the non-intrusive and privacy-preserving characteristics of radio signals.

We focus on healthcare in the radio world, leveraging the advances in wireless technology in all aspects of healthcare. Our recent research aims to develop contactless healthcare monitoring schemes based on commercial radio systems to achieve physiological information monitoring and health-critical human behaviors sensing under clinical and in-home environments. Physiological information monitoring: We not only precisely measure the respiration and heartbeat rate, but also look deeper into the human body, e.g., monitoring electrocardiogram and blood pressure contactlessly. The proposed hybrid pipeline of signal processing and deep learning framework first extracts human micro-activity measurements from RF signal and then predicts the ECG and blood pressure with an interpretable neural networks that incorporate domain knowledge of RF signal and physiological models. Health-critical human behaviors sensing: Beyond the physiological information, we also exploit RF signal to sense health-critical human behaviors such as fall. Our RF-based fall detection system utilizes spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks to aggregate information across space and time and extract the corresponding complex spatio-temporal patterns. We address the main challenge in practice fall detection, including dealing with complex falls and fast non-fall movements, generalization to new environments and detecting falls in the presence of other motion.\n","date":1628335835,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628335835,"objectID":"3a5ddc0c3e9c4df1042bafc167d171f5","permalink":"/projects/digitalhealth/","publishdate":"2021-08-07T19:30:35+08:00","relpermalink":"/projects/digitalhealth/","section":"projects","summary":"Advances in machine learning and contactless sensors have given rise to digital health.
